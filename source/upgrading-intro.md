# Upgrading

Welcome to the upgrade guide for Factory Muffin. We've tried to cover all changes from 1.4 through to the current release. If we've missed anything, feel free to create an issue, or send a pull request. From 2.0, we are following the PSR-2 coding standard, and semantic versioning, so there will be no BC breaks until 3.0 other than essential fixes, and any changes will be documented here.
